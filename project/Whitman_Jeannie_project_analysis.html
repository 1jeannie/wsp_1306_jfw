	<h1> Project Analysis </h1>
		<p> Client: Exotic Animal Experience (exoticexperience.net) </p>
		<p> Project: Redesign of Website </p>
		<p> Designer: Jeannie Whitman </p>
	<h2> Site Intent </h2>
		<p> The clients intent for the redesign is to have a more streamlined, user friendly site that will allow
			future marketability of their services. </p>
		<p> This will be accomplished by a total redesign using current standards for responsiveness, mobile first considerations,
			changing some page headings, eliminating redundant content, organizing and structuring of photo gallery, changes to background styling, 
			changes to font styling, as well as page layout for a more consistent look and feel.
	<h2> Competitive Analysis </h2>
		<p> The competitive analysis was conducted using alexa.com, yelp.com, and google search. 
			The following local competitors offer similar services and can be found using keywords such as, petting zoo, exotic,
			adventure, birthday parties, sight seeing tours etc.  While very little data is available, what is known is that
			visitors to these sights view an average of 3 pages per visit, and 78% are from the U.S., they are predominately
			female.  The other noted difference is that these sites are all dot coms and it is recommended that the client
			invest in the dot com URL instead of the current URL which is a dot net. </p>
